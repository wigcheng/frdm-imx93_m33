# tmu_3_monitor_report

## Overview
The TMU example shows how to configure TMU register to monitor and report the temperature from one 
remote temperature measurement sites located on the chip.

TMU has access to temperature measurement site strategically located on the
chip. It monitors the site and can signal an alarm if a programmed threshold is ever
exceeded.

Note: Before monitoring the temperature, we must programming the calibration table.
